https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-for-C-for-the-beginner-intermediate-and-advanced-levels



It seems a long time ago, anyway I read (completely or a few chapters) the current edition or previous editions of the following books, I like them and I learnt a lot from them. There are other books that I dont like or hate,much more than what is listed below, so I wont list them here:

0- Beginning

I would recommend either of the two books for beginners.

- [Head First C#: Jennifer Greene, Andrew Stellman: 9781449343507: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-C-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449343503/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1473580988&sr=8-10&keywords=c%23). The book does a great job at presenting the important concepts (like Object Orietation) in casual way that make them easy to remember and understand with lots of photoes and funny visualization.
- [Murach's C# 2015: Anne Boehm, Joel Murach: 9781890774943: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-C-2015-Anne-Boehm/dp/1890774944/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1473580988&sr=8-9&keywords=c%23). Like all Murach books, this book uses the unique style of pair-page. Through this style, you can learn some topic on the left page and then you will immediately review the short summary of that topic and some code snippet on the right page. This is very effective for not only memorizing the topics, but for understanding the topic.

1-Reference Books:

- [CLR via C# (Developer Reference) 4, Jeffrey Richter, eBook - Amazon.com ](https://www.amazon.com/CLR-via-4th-Developer-Reference/dp/B00JDMQJKQ/ref=sr_1_26?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473581078&sr=1-26&keywords=c%23)I recommend this book to every serious C#developer. This book is a fantastic tour of the CLR. Virtually every aspect of the C# (as a language) is explained in detail. This is my favorite book.
- [C# 6.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference: Joseph Albahari, Ben Albahari: 9781491927069: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/C-6-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491927062/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1463825630&sr=8-4&keywords=C%23). This is a perfect book on C# as a language with lots of details (if you know Java or C++ start with this one).
- [C# 6.0 and the .NET 4.6 Framework: ANDREW TROELSEN, Philip Japikse: 9781484213339: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/C-6-0-NET-4-6-Framework/dp/1484213335/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463825630&sr=8-1&keywords=C%23). This book provides an in-depth overview of Object-Oriented language along with details of CIL (Common Intermediate Language-CIL). The book has several chapters on WPF, WCF and [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/)(starting from chapter 26). IMHO it is better to read other books about these topics, especially on ASP. NET.
- [Professional C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0: Christian Nagel: 9781119096603: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-NET-Core-Christian-Nagel/dp/111909660X/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1463825630&sr=8-7&keywords=C%23). This book covers a wide range of topics in good detail from working with Visual Studio to WPF to SignalR. Some chapters are really good but there are a few chapters that could be written better.

2- [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/)

- [Beginning ASP.NET 4.5.1: in C# and VB (Wrox Programmer to Programmer): Imar Spaanjaars: 9781118846773: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-ASP-NET-4-5-1-Wrox-Programmer/dp/111884677X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463826562&sr=1-2&keywords=asp.net) . The best book on WebForms for beginners. Note that WebForms has been around since 2001 (from the beginning of .NET). This book is very good if you have experience in VB6.0 or Desktop Windows Applications.
- [Applied ASP.NET 4 in Context: Adam Freeman: 9781430234678: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Applied-ASP-NET-Context-Adam-Freeman/dp/1430234679/ref=sr_1_16?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463826932&sr=1-16&keywords=adam+freeman). If you want to understand details of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) framework, this book is for you.
- [Pro ASP.NET 4.5 in C#: Adam Freeman, Matthew MacDonald, Mario Szpuszta: 9781430242543: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-4-5-Adam-Freeman/dp/143024254X/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463826763&sr=1-10&keywords=adam+freeman). This book is the best reference book on [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) WebForms. Contains lots of important topics on security, best practices of management of data (cache and database) and design patterns for web application development.
- IMHO I haven’t seen any good book about [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC for beginners!
- [Pro ASP.NET MVC 5 (Expert's Voice in ASP.Net): Adam Freeman: 9781430265290: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-Experts-Voice-ASP-Net/dp/1430265299/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463826562&sr=1-8&keywords=asp.net). The is one of the best books about [ASP.NET ](http://asp.net/)MVC (or the best).
- [Professional ASP.NET MVC 5: Jon Galloway, Brad Wilson, K. Scott Allen, David Matson: 9781118794753: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-MVC-Jon-Galloway/dp/1118794753/ref=pd_sim_14_7?ie=UTF8&dpID=51oG1j5vXDL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR127%2C160_&refRID=1PFJ86T6T49E3KRWX2RP). This book is an excellent choice if you want to learn applied MVC.

Another excellent book on Web API ([ ASP.NET ](http://asp.net/)MVC) from Adam Freeman.

3- [ADO.NET](http://ado.net/)

- Entity Framework and LINQ[Programming Microsoft ADO.NET 2.0 Core Reference (Developer Reference): David Sceppa: 9780735622067: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Microsoft%C2%AE-ADO-NET-Reference-Developer/dp/073562206X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463827486&sr=1-2&keywords=ado.net+2.0). The best book on ADO. NET. I dont know about its current version (but I read the second edition and it is excellent) however this one is a reference with lots of (in fact more than enough) detailed explanation and examples.
- [Murach's ADO.NET 4 Database Programming with C# 2010 (Murach: Training & Reference): Anne Boehm, Ged Mead: 9781890774639: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Murachs-ADO-NET-Database-Programming-Murach/dp/1890774634/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463827596&sr=1-4&keywords=ado.net+4) Good book for learning about LINQ and EF for beginners. The examples are for windows forms applications (not WPF) and web applications (web forms, not MVC).
- [Programming Entity Framework: Building Data Centric Apps with the ADO.NET Entity Framework: Julia Lerman: 9780596807269: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Entity-Framework-Building-Centric/dp/0596807260/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463827887&sr=1-1&keywords=entity+framework). Comprehensive coverage of Entity Framework and LINQ to EF.
- [Entity Framework 6 Recipes: Zeeshan Hirani, Larry Tenny, Nitin Gupta, Brian Driscoll, Robert Vettor: 9781430257882: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Entity-Framework-Recipes-Zeeshan-Hirani/dp/1430257881/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463827887&sr=1-3&keywords=entity+framework). If you prefer to learn LINQ and a part of EF using short and small examples, this book is a good starting point.

4- XAML

- [Pro WPF 4.5 in C#: Windows Presentation Foundation in .NET 4.5: Matthew MacDonald: 9781430243656: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-WPF-4-5-Presentation-Foundation/dp/1430243651/ref=sr_1_28?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463828365&sr=1-28&keywords=XAML). The book explains more than enough about WPF and XAML, and it has a clear style of writing.
- [Programming Windows: Writing Windows 8 Apps With C# and XAML (Developer Reference): Charles Petzold: 9780735671768: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-Writing-Developer-Reference/dp/0735671761/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463827739&sr=1-5&keywords=windows+programming). Very good book on creating modern style windows 8+ apps. Previous editions of this book was on Windows Forms.

5- WCF

- [Programming WCF Services: Juval Lowy: 9780596526993: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WCF-Services-Juval-Lowy/dp/0596526997/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1463828742&sr=1-6&keywords=WCF). I loved the 2007 edition of this book. The book is not for beginners. The book explains about every aspect of WCF services and best practices about them (so called ABC s of WCF services). A chapter about security is a bit short. The 2010 edition (.NET 4.0) expands the topics from previous edition to include a chapter on Windows Azure (this chapter is obsolete now). The latest edition of the book covers the topics in previous two editions and provide even more best practices. Note that this is not a book for starters, it is intended for experienced developers with some previous exposure to distributed, service oriented computing or Microservices.

6-Xamarin

- [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms Preview Edition 2 (Developer Reference) 1, Charles Petzold, eBook - Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Xamarin-Forms-Preview-Developer-Reference-ebook/dp/B00VYSSNJW?ie=UTF8&keywords=xamirin&qid=1463829537&ref_=sr_1_sc_1&s=books&sr=1-1-spell). If you want clear explanation of how to use C# for developing mobile apps for Android, iOS or Windows Phone, this is one of the best.

Have a nice journey in C#!
